Open-Access Computational Biology Datasets

## Description

Efficiently access a curated library of open-access computational biology 
datasets. Datasets support predicate pushdown and projection to the cloud 
storage backend, enabling quick, iterative access to otherwise massive, 
unwieldy datasets.

## Usage

See the `python/` and `r/` subdirectories for client packages.

## Dataset Requests

To request the addition of a new dataset to the library, open an
[issue](https://github.com/bedrock-bio/bedrock-bio-client/issues).
