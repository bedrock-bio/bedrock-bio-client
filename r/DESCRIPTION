Title: An API for Querying Datasets from the Bedrock Bio Library

Description: A simple application programming interface (API) for querying
    curated datasets from the Bedrock Bio library. The API consists of two
    user-facing functions -- `list_datasets()`, which returns a list of
    available datasets, and `load_dataset()`, which takes a dataset name 
    and returns a lazily-evaluated data frame object. `dplyr` verbs (`filter`, 
    `select`) can be used on the returned data frame to push down row filters 
    and column selections to the storage backend, downloading and reading into 
    memory only the requested subset of data.
