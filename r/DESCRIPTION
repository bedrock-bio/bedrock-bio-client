Description: A simple application programming interface (API) for querying
    curated datasets from the Bedrock Bio library. The API consists of a
    single user-facing function, `load()`, which takes a dataset name and
    returns a lazily-evaluated `Dataset` object (defined in the `arrow`
    package). `dplyr` verbs (`filter`, `select`) can be used on the
    returned `Dataset` to push down row filters and column selections to
    the storage backend, downloading and reading into memory only the
    requested subset of data.
